This is a test file for testing grep commands.
Some lines have ordinary text, some have tabbed columns, some have mixtures
of tabs and space.  There are embedded control characters and other non-visible
characters.  For test purposes these have been placed in the file even
though under normal operations they would not be entered via the keyboard. 
However, if you are processing data files output from another program, you might
find such characters.
The next line is an empty line (no characters)

The next line has just spaces
                
The next line has just tabs
			
The next line has a mix of spaces and tabs
    	   			      			        	 	 
tabbed	columns	of	text	in	this	line
and	another	line	of	tabbed	columns
This line has some other control characters and the
next line has only "invisible" characters:

        		    	     
And this has a mix of everything	 in     it, including digits: 1,2,3,...25 .
