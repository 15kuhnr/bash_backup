#	I got this code working, so I am not going to try very hard on the roomcheckone part. I am going to work on it just in case this doesn't run properly on your computer. Note that in the file I got from the server, there are 5 sections in room CB195, instead of the 4 that are suggested on the test.

#count how many fields there are in the file
fields=$(head -1 $1 | wc -w) 

cat $1 | cut -f6 | sort -u > temp

#count how many lines are in file
lines=$(wc -l temp | cut -f1 --delimiter=' ')

#create menu
for (( i=1; i<=$lines; i++ )); do
room=$(head -n$i temp | tail -n1)
printf "$i) $room\n"
done

printf "Please select a room: "
read selection
until [[ $selection -le $lines && $selection -gt 0 ]]; do
printf "Sorry, input is invalid. Please try again.\n\nPlease try again: "
read selection
done

room=$(head -n$selection temp |tail -n1)
sections=$(cat $1 | cut -f6 | grep $room | wc -l | cut -f1 --delimiter=' ')
case $sections in
1) printf "There is $sections section in $room.\n";;
*) printf "There are $sections sections in $room.\n";;
esac

#Clean up, clean up, everybody, everywhere, clean up, clean up, everybody do you your share!
rm temp
